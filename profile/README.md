CampbellHacks will be hosting a hackathon targeted towards high school students who are interested in computer science. Our hackathon aims to provide students from public and private schools with an amazing learning experience since hackathons are a great place to start learning about LLMs, frameworks, and more! We strive to provide a space open to all people while also creating connections with students.
